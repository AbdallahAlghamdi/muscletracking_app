# Muscle Tracking Application
Application for patients with muscle atrophy alongside their physicians. The application is written in the Dart language and the Flutter framework. Simulate what an arduino microconroller with an EMG sensor would provide in an exercise, but the project does not connect to any microcontroller currently.
Functionality of the project:
- Account management: Users can login, logout and sign up a new account.
- Exercises: Patients can select a muscle group and go through the process of exercising
- Mail: Patient and physicians can communicate through the application without any third party.
- Reports: Patients see a small summary of their progress, meanwhile physicians see additional data, alongside a graph to visualize the data.
